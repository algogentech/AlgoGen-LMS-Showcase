# 🎓 AlgoGen E-Learning Platform

A modern full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) designed for seamless online education — enabling instructors to sell courses, ebooks, and manage learners efficiently.

This repository is a **showcase** version of our full private project built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).  
It includes details, previews, and a live demo link — but **no source code**, as the full system is a commercial product.
